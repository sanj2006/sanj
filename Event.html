    Single brand, single kitchen, no storefront. This is the original cloud kitchen model. A restaurant with no seating space and no physical store. Restaurant owners or food business entrants sidestepping high rents and real estate costs by shedding the front-of-house. This concept gained popularity with the growth of online ordering and growing consumer demand for deliveries.
